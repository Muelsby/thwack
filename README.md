Because we all have participated in failed game projects, we wanted to create some guidelines for this project. Hopefully, by following these guidelines, we can keep the project moving forward.

1. Do real work - everything we do should result in a modification to the github project, either the source code, the wiki, or an issue. 

2. Propose experiments - Excessive discussion is dangerous. Speculation is useless, and usually doesn't result in a decision or action. Create an experiment that will result in a decision. Track it with an issue.

3. Status update - When you accomplish something, let everybody know. (If you are following rule #1, github should send updates when anything changes).

4. Review others' contributions - Don't just glance at it. Review it, understand it, critique it, identify next steps, etc.
